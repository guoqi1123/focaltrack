# Focal Track
This repository accompanies Guo et al. [1], with the code of the focal track algorithm. For more information of the paper, please go to the project website http://vision.seas.harvard.edu/focaltrack/.

Raw measurements and the depth maps of 100+ scenes captured by the prototype can be found in this [link](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/j391ct8yutesm73kgh84l/AM9qxG1EvejjoyT1UFD1vos?rlkey=nsnn71odtkeqcquy04wn1wid4&st=hwsiia1m&dl=0).

The file focaltrack.py contains the implementation of focaltrack algorithm. For details of end-to-end training, please refer to ./extra.

For questions, please email qiguo@purdue.edu.
